DESCRIPTION:

	This is a very primitive sound advice for Linux. Well...
What a reason to do all this fuck with direct port I/O, if there are XBell(3)
and printf("\a")?! The reason is simple: all these cool things needs specific
client to be connected, so they can BEEP'em. And, sure, they don't work if used
as sound advice for telnetd daemon (that haven't client), for example.


USAGE:

	Here I'll try to explain how to make your computer beep when
someone tries to connect your machine through telnetd(8):
(Heheh, enjoy that, t0p ;)

-- lines from /etc/inetd.conf --
(blah blah blah)
telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.telnetd -L /usr/local/sbin/login_
(blah blah blah)
-- end --

-- lines from /usr/local/sbin/login_ --
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/sbin/demoniac &
exec login $*
-- end --

Sure, that you may
chmod +x login_


BUGS:

	o This fuck accesses hardware I/O directly, so...
	  Read IO-Port-Programming-HOWTO if you didn't
	  know what does it means ;)
	o The music it plays is quite stupid


FUTURE VERSIONS:

	(If any ;) At first, I wanna say, this is just a toy
(well, I spent 3 hours to make it, but it's just because my C is poor);
so I'm not gonna develop it. Just some add-ons when I got free time
or/and drunk... But, anyway:

	o More flexibility; play specific sounds and files (maybe DOS .MUS?!).
	o New name ("demoniac" is quite unhappy...).
	o Strip sound funcions and put them in static lib.


THANKS:

	o t0p, for idea of daemon beeper
	o Dr. Checks, for music (it rocks!)
	o Riku Saikkonen, for his IO-Port-Programming-HOWTO
	o Peter Norton, for PC Speaker beepin' algorithm
