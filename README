DESCRIPTION:

	This is a very primitive sound advice for Linux. Well...
What a reason to do all this fuck with direct port I/O, if there are XBell(3)
and printf("\a")?! The reason is simple: all these cool things needs specific
client to be connected, so they can BEEP'em. And, sure, they don't work if used
as sound advice for telnetd daemon (that haven't client), for example.


USAGE:

	Here I'll try to explain how to make your computer beep when
someone tries to connect your machine through telnetd(8):
(Heheh, enjoy that, t0p ;)

-- lines from /etc/inetd.conf --
(blah blah blah)
telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.telnetd -L /usr/local/sbin/login_
(blah blah blah)
-- end --

-- lines from /usr/local/sbin/login_ --
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/sbin/demoniac &
exec login $*
-- end --

Sure, that you may
chmod +x login_


BUGS:

	o This fuck accesses hardware I/O directly, so...
	  Read IO-Port-Programming-HOWTO if you didn't
	  know what does it means ;)
	o Bass and drums not available at now... FFFFFUCK!!!


CHANGES:

Major changes since 0.3b:
	*) Now cn be interrupted with no sound hang!
	*) demoniac.c comment now explains how to compile it

Major changes since 0.2b:
	*) More hillary README
	*) Now plays "Fear Of The Dark"!!!!!!!!!
	*) More advanced music timing

Major changes since 0.1b:
	First public release!!!

FUTURE VERSIONS:

	(If any ;) At first, I wanna say, this is just a toy
(well, I spent 3 hours to make it, but it's just because my C is poor);
so I'm not gonna develop it. Just some add-ons when I got free time
or/and drunk... But, anyway:

	o More flexibility; play specific sounds and files (maybe MP3?!).
	o New name ("demoniac" is quite unhappy...).
	o Strip sound funcions and put them in static lib.
